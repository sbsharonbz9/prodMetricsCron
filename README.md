Created in response to an workflow automation requirement. 
Manual testers were looking through a large csv and, taking the values provided in the metrics or previous runs, starting with the "OUTCOME" mertric value, and reversing the workflow to
ensure the previous step selection when entered throughout the workflow would have resulted in the expected outcome. This script when called from shell also sends the output file through Slack.
